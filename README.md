# LaunchCode-Project-2---Goodreads
Goodreads dataset is fairly feature-poor and not great for building predictive models. However, it is an awesome dataset for EDA.   
That's mainly what this repository consists of.  First in pandas, secord, in R shiny.
This project was originally assigned for the purpose of improving scientific presentation via R Shiny.  
Near the end of the project track, the assignment was modified because the Goodreads dataset is fairly feature-poor
and not great for building predictive models. Instead of working on modeling the Goodreads dataset, the following was assigned: 
1.	 use the model predictions from the heart disease project (below), if you tried a few different tuning parameters,
make a UI that shows how predictions change if you drop a feature, or modify a hyperparameter.
Go back to this modeling result for the remainder of the project track R shiny integration work.
2.	Your mentors will find new datasets on Kaggle (or elsewhere) that actually are amenable to modeling, 
particularly unsupervised models (which we didn't do as much during the learning track).
We'll provide these links to you before project track is over, in order for you to practice on your own 
as you continue to build out a few modeling examples in prep for job interviews.
I, however, found the Goodreads data extremely useful for practicing data exploratory and management 
as well as pandas operations in general.  I have constructed a few subdataframes that I have started 
exploring in R Shiny.  My R Shiny apps for both these datasets and the heart disease project will be 
posted on github in the very near future. 
As for the 2nd part of the project track assignment, no new datasets were assigned.  
I intend to find a dataset on my own (likely from NCBI) and construct an independent project.
